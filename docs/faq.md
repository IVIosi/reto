## Is it another "redux"?

No, Reto is the replacement for redux and redux-saga. It does the same thing as they do (building app's model layer), but in a more flexible and efficient way.

## Can I use Reto in production?

Yes, currently we are using Reto in a product at Alibaba.

## Will Reto increase my bundle size significantly?

No, Reto is very very simple and small.

## Can I use Reto in a TypeScript project?

Of course. Reto itself is written in TypeScript.
