## Is it another "redux"?

No, Reto is the replacement for redux and redux-saga. It does the same thing as they do (building app's model layer), but in a more flexible and efficient way.

## Can I use Reto in production?

Yes, currently we are using Reto in a product at Alibaba.

## Will Reto increase my bundle size significantly?

No, Reto is very very simple and small.

## Can I use Reto in a TypeScript project?

Of course. Reto itself is written in TypeScript.

## Can I use Reto with React 16.7 or lower?

Sorry you can't. Reto is based on the "hooks" feature which is introduced in React 16.8. So if you want to use Reto, you need to upgrade React to 16.8 or higher.
